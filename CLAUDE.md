# mavericks-golang

Cross-builds a **patched Go 1.27.1 toolchain that installs and runs on Mac OS X 10.9
(Mavericks)** — with out-of-the-box cgo, keychain∪bundle verified TLS, and a Sparkle
auto-updater — entirely on modern hardware. No 10.9 build runner anywhere.

**Status:** The Go 1.27 line, from its sibling `golang-126`, with trust semantics kept
unchanged (patches 0005–0010 and 0013–0018, tracked in `PORT.md`). Built and proven end to
end on real 10.9.5 hardware (`ultimate-hat`) on 2026-09-26, installed side by side with
golang-126: separate trees, updaters and feeds, the selection untouched, the trust
acceptance and the pure-Go link gate all passing, and a clean uninstall. The first release,
`1.27.1-mavericks.1`, is auto-cut by the first push to `main`. Ships as
`golang-<gover>-native-mavericks.<rev>.pkg` and `golang-<gover>-cross-mavericks.<rev>.pkg`,
which install `/usr/local/mavergreen/go127` and `/usr/local/mavergreen/go127-cross`.

## Build / release

- `sh build/build-native.sh` — **Rosetta-free**: fetch go1.27.1 → apply `patches/` → build
  static macports-legacy-support → native arm64 `make.bash` builder → cross `go install cmd` for
  amd64 (via a build-time `-arch x86_64`/min-10.9 CC wrapper) → assemble amd64 GOROOT (local `WORK`).
  No amd64 code runs in the build path; Rosetta is only an optional post-build self-test.
- `sh build/package-pkg.sh` — stage the updater + LaunchAgent, wrap with the 10.9.5 floor →
  `.pkg` + tarball + `manifest/`.
- `MAVERICKS_HOST=ultimate-hat sh tests/smoke-mavericks.sh [installer]` — on-box smoke.
- `sh tests/trust/smoke-trust.sh` — TLS-trust acceptance (pinned LE endpoints).
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` — CI build → EdDSA-sign → appcast → Release. Three triggers: push
  to `main` (auto-cuts `<upstream>-mavericks.1` if unreleased), a `*-mavericks.*` tag, or
  `workflow_dispatch local_release=true`.
- **This repo ships ONE Go minor line (1.27) from the repo root.** `UPSTREAM_VERSION` and `patches/`
  live at the top level, not under a per-line directory; everything else derives from the line number
  (the products `go127` and `go127-cross` in `/usr/local/mavergreen/`, group `go`,
  `dev.mavergreen.golang.go127`, the product title, and, through shipyard's registry, each updater's
  bundle id, LaunchAgent label and feed `<short>.xml` at `/releases/latest/download/`; there is no
  separate feed release). The line number is itself **derived** from `UPSTREAM_VERSION`
  (`build/version.sh line`; 1.27.1 → 127), never configured separately.
  - **A new Go minor line is a NEW REPO**, forked from this one (`Mavergreen/golang-126` is this
    line's own sibling, forked the same way) — not a second directory here. It inherits this repo's
    `patches/` as its starting point. `docs/` is gitignored here (tracked out-of-band, not present in
    a clone). This repo's Renovate cap (`allowedVersions` on `go-127`, capped just below the next Go
    minor) is what keeps this repo on 1.27.x so it can never drift onto the next line by itself. A new
    line gets noticed the ordinary way: a consumer's routine Renovate bump needing the next Go minor
    fails its build.
  - The gates are what keep a line safe to ship, not fuzzy patch application: patches 0005–0010 and
    0013–0018 are the keychain-union trust model in `src/crypto/x509`, exactly where Go churns between
    minors. A fuzzy apply (`patch -p0 -F 3`) can succeed and be wrong — that is what `tests/trust/`,
    `tests/port-md-test.sh` and the compat guard are for. **Never relax those to make a build green.**
    `PORT.md` is the authority for why each carried patch exists; a spec disagreeing with it loses.
- Upstream Go version lives in `UPSTREAM_VERSION` (bare `x.y.z`, Renovate-managed) at the repo root.
  `build/version.sh <auto|local>` derives the full `<upstream>-mavericks.N` + a `RELEASE=yes/no`
  decision from existing `*-mavericks.*` tags: `auto` is `N=1`/`RELEASE=yes` for a new upstream (no
  tag yet), else current `N`/`RELEASE=no`; `local` (via `workflow_dispatch local_release`) is always
  `N=maxN+1`/`RELEASE=yes`. `VERSION` (the full string) is workflow-written and **gitignored** —
  never committed.
- Renovate auto-bumps `UPSTREAM_VERSION` (capped to this repo's line) and automerges the PR **once the
  build is green** — patch, minor and major alike, per the family's ship-if-green policy. This repo
  needs no extra `packageRules` beyond the cap: a Go minor bump past the cap never opens a PR at all,
  and within the cap a bad bump just fails the build. The bootstrap Go (`actions/setup-go`) is capped
  the same way (`1.27.x`, capped just below the next Go minor): it is self-hosting and so an
  ingredient, not CI trivia — a golang-126 incident showed a mergeable bump to the next minor's
  bootstrap compiler with nothing but a green build standing in the way. `ignoreTests: false` comes
  from the **shared preset** — don't restate it here, or this repo silently stops tracking the preset.
- A push to `main` whose upstream has no release yet auto-cuts `<upstream>-mavericks.1` via
  `gh release create` in `release.yml` (no PAT — `gh` mints the tag itself). Don't also push a
  manual tag for that release; that re-triggers CI and rebuilds/republishes the same version.

## Transitional: the trust overlay lives in two repos

The keychain-union trust model (patches 0005–0010 and 0013–0018) is not yet extracted into its own
shared ingredient repo. **Exit condition:** the overlay patches (0007–0009, 0014, 0015, 0017) exist
only in golang-port, and neither line repo carries them. Until then the two line repos carry
identical copies; a change to one must be made to the other in the same week. See the spec's
Sequencing step 3.

## Non-obvious invariants (details in `memory/`)

- **Repo is on NFS — build on local disk** (`WORK` defaults to `~/.cache`). [[mavericks-golang-nfs-build-location]]
- **Every darwin/amd64 link goes through the CC wrapper, pure Go included.** The toolchains are built
  with `GO_EXTLINK_ENABLED=darwin/amd64` baked in (patches 0011/0012): Go internal-links cgo-free
  binaries otherwise, and those die on 10.9 (`_clock_gettime`). Other GOOS targets keep the automatic
  choice. `tests/pure-go-link.sh` is the gate (CI: cross toolchain; box: `smoke-mavericks.sh`).
- **The amd64 toolchain is cross-linked `-linkmode=external`** so the toolchain's own binaries (go/gofmt/tools)
  route through the min-10.9 CC wrapper — Go 1.27 internal-links pure-Go darwin binaries to a 13.0
  floor otherwise (golang-126's Go internal-linked to a 12.0 floor), which the CC wrapper avoids for
  darwin/amd64. `link-recipe.sh` (the old `-extldflags`/`GO_EXTLINK_ENABLED` plumbing) is gone; the CC
  wrappers inject the shim directly. [[mavericks-golang-downstream-linking]]
- **The cross toolchain needs macOS 13+.** `CROSS_MIN_OS` in `build/versions.sh` sets the cross
  archive's install floor and the appcast `--min-os`; its own binaries carry Go's own 13.0 stamp
  (Go 1.27's linker defaults `LC_BUILD_VERSION` to macOS 13.0), declared as `sdk-pin`/`floor`
  deviations in `INGREDIENTS.md`. The native toolchain's own floor is unchanged: every darwin/amd64
  link still goes through the min-10.9 CC wrapper, so native output stays 10.9.
- **The trust model:** crypto/x509's system roots on darwin are the keychain union — all three trust
  domains read with Go 1.17's precedence- and policy-aware code, ∪ every existing CA bundle, minus
  distrust — served through a one-line hook at the top of the shared `loadSystemRoots` (patches
  0005–0010, 0013–0018; `PORT.md` is the authority for each one, enforced by `tests/port-md-test.sh`).
  This is kept **unchanged from golang-126 on purpose**, and differs from upstream Go 1.27:
  `SSL_CERT_FILE`/`SSL_CERT_DIR` shape the union's bundle files rather than replacing it, and
  `GODEBUG=x509sslcertoverrideplatform` has no effect on darwin here. `GODEBUG=x509usefallbackroots=0`
  selects Apple's verifier, which works on 10.9: its crash was Go passing a NULL-callback CFArray of
  policies. Reading the USER domain doesn't prompt in any context tested (a locked login keychain is
  untested; the prompt guards writes). Acceptance: `tests/trust/acceptance-onbox.sh` + the
  semi-manual steps in `smoke-trust.sh`.
- **Sparkle updater + EdDSA keys** (private key = `SPARKLE_PRIVATE_KEY` secret). [[mavericks-golang-sparkle-updater]]
- **Renovate's Go patch auto-release trusts go.dev's feed-verified sha256** (`build/fetch-go.sh`,
  `build/go-src-sha256.sh`), not a pinned checksum, and requires no PAT/App token — deliberately,
  so don't add one.
- Apple `/usr/bin/clang` required for cgo/ObjC. Reuse `../mavergreen-shipyard`; don't duplicate.
