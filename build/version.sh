# CMakeLists.txt already derives MAVGO_LINE the same way, and two sources of truth for "which line
# is this" is how a repo builds one line's Go and stamps another's identifier. A caller-supplied
# $GO_LINE is honoured only as a CHECK against the derived value, never as an override -- pairing a
# GO_LINE that disagrees with UPSTREAM_VERSION is a bug, not a way to build a different line.
