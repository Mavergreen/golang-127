# Build ingredients

Everything baked into the shipped `.pkg`s, and how a change to it reaches a release. An
*ingredient* is an input to the product; the *own upstream* is the thing this repo exists to
port. An own-upstream bump cuts `<upstream>-mavericks.1`; an ingredient bump cuts a
`-mavericks.(N+1)` repackage of the same upstream, via
`.github/workflows/repackage-on-ingredient-bump.yml`.

| Ingredient | Pinned in | Renovate | On a bump |
|---|---|---|---|
| Go source (own upstream) | `UPSTREAM_VERSION` | ✅ `golang-version` datasource, **capped to this line** (`<1.28`), patch-automerged | `release.yml` on push to main cuts `-mavericks.1` |
| macports-legacy-support shim (prebuilt) | `MLS_VERSION # mavericks-legacysupport` in `build/versions.sh` | ✅ shared preset's `# mavericks-legacysupport` customManager | `build/versions.sh` is a watched path → repackage dispatched |
| curl.se CA bundle | `vendor/cacert.pem`, hash-pinned by `CA_SHA256` in `build/versions.sh` | ❌ **untrackable — manual refresh** (see below) | both are watched paths → repackage dispatched when the refresh lands |
| Bootstrap Go (builds the toolchain) | `go-version: '1.27.x'` on `actions/setup-go` in `.github/workflows/release.yml` | ✅ github-actions `uses-with`, **capped to this line** (`<1.28`) | `release.yml` is not a watched path, so cut the repackage deliberately |
| MacOSX10.9 SDK, Sparkle framework | `Mavergreen/shipyard@v1` | ✅ github-actions manager tracks the tag | `@v1` is a *moving* tag, so content moves without any path changing (see below) |

Not ingredients: `patches/` and the build scripts are this repo's own recipe — a change there is
a repackage you cut deliberately (`workflow_dispatch` with `local_release=true`), not something
Renovate drives.

## Why the bootstrap Go is capped to this line

(golang-126, 2026-09) Go is self-hosting: the `go-version` handed to `actions/setup-go` is the
compiler that builds the toolchain we ship. That makes it an ingredient, not CI housekeeping, and
it went undeclared here until it proved the point — Renovate opened "update dependency go to
1.27.x" against a repo capped to 1.26.x, and it was mergeable. Automerge is ship-if-green, so
nothing but a passing build stood between us and a 1.26 toolchain built by a 1.27 compiler.

Two things were wrong with that. Changing the compiler changes a shipped artifact's inputs with no
upstream reason — `UPSTREAM_VERSION` is still 1.26.5, so the product did not change, only how it was
made. And no BUILD INPUT may be on 1.27 in a repo that must never build it: a new Go line is a new
repo.

So it is capped `<1.27` like the line itself, and still tracked within it: 1.26.x bootstrap updates
land normally. Raising the cap is the same deliberate act as creating a new line repo.

## Why the CA bundle is untracked

`CA_URL` is a rolling URL (`https://curl.se/ca/cacert.pem`), so there is no version for Renovate to
compare — and scraping curl.se's extract page for the current date would be exactly the fragile
tracker we don't want.

Nothing drifts in the meantime, because the bundle is **vendored**: `build/fetch-ca.sh` uses the
committed `vendor/cacert.pem` and verifies it against `CA_SHA256`, and only re-downloads when that
file is absent or `MAVERICKS_CA_REFRESH=1` says to. Builds are reproducible and a rotation upstream
changes nothing here until someone chooses to take it.

So the cost of being untracked is not a broken build — it's that **nobody is told** when Mozilla
publishes new roots. Refresh deliberately:

```sh
MAVERICKS_CA_REFRESH=1 sh build/fetch-ca.sh   # re-download; prints the new sha256
# paste it into CA_SHA256 (keep the Mozilla date in the trailing comment), commit both files
```

That commit touches `build/versions.sh` *and* `vendor/cacert.pem`, both of which the repackage
caller watches, so the rebuilt-with-new-roots release cuts itself.

If the silence ever matters more than the simplicity, the clean fix is a dated pin
(`https://curl.se/ca/cacert-YYYY-MM-DD.pem`) plus a Renovate custom datasource over curl.se's
extract page — a real version to bump instead of a bare hash.

## Why `shipyard@v1` is a blind spot

`@v1` is a moving major tag, so shipyard's own commits change what we build with while the pin
string stays `v1`. Renovate can only tell us about `v1 → v2`. That is deliberate (shipyard is
ours, and its changes are gated by its own CI), but it means a shipyard fix does **not**
auto-repackage anything downstream — cut those repackages by hand when they matter.

## Conformance deviations

- rosetta:.github/workflows/release.yml: the release job optionally installs Rosetta (`softwareupdate --install-rosetta --agree-to-license || true`) so `tests/rosetta-selftest.sh` can exercise the cross-produced darwin/amd64 toolchain by running it, not just inspecting its files. Both the install and the test invocation are `|| true`: this step never gates the build, it only adds a self-test when Rosetta happens to be available on the runner. Reconsider when this self-test can run on an x86_64 host (the 10.9 box or an Intel runner) instead; at the latest before macOS 28 removes Rosetta.
- rosetta:tests/rosetta-selftest.sh: runs the staged darwin/amd64 `go` binary directly (`"$go_bin" version`, then a pure-Go compile+link+run) on the arm64 CI runner; macOS transparently routes that `exec` through Rosetta, so no `arch -x86_64` appears here even though every invocation is translated. SKIPs cleanly (exit 0, "amd64 exec unavailable (no Rosetta)") when translation is unavailable, and the script is itself only ever invoked best-effort. Reconsider when this self-test can run on an x86_64 host instead of via Rosetta; at the latest before macOS 28 removes Rosetta.
- sdk-pin:*/src/debug/dwarf/testdata/typedef.macho*: upstream Go's DWARF test fixtures, Mach-O objects the Go team compiled long ago; shipped verbatim as source-tree testdata and never run as a program
- sdk-pin:*/src/runtime/race/*darwin*.syso: upstream Go's prebuilt race-detector runtime objects, shipped verbatim as part of std's source tree and linked only into a user's -race build
- sdk-pin:*/go127-cross/bin/*: Go 1.27 requires macOS 13 and its linker stamps 13.0 (macho.go macVersionFlag{13,0,0}); the cross toolchain's own binaries are Go-linked, not relinked against the pinned SDK.
- sdk-pin:*/go127-cross/pkg/tool/darwin_arm64/*: Go 1.27 requires macOS 13 and its linker stamps 13.0 (macho.go macVersionFlag{13,0,0}); the cross toolchain's own binaries are Go-linked, not relinked against the pinned SDK.
- floor:golang-*-cross-*.pkg: the cross toolchain runs on macOS 13 and later (arm64) and only targets 10.9 -- Go 1.27 requires macOS 13 -- so its archive's install floor is 13.0, not 10.9.5
